I tend to be afk or doing stuff while on ponytown, but if you whisper to me I will eventually answer back! I am very into HOUSE MD (BIGGEST INTEREST PLEASE TALK TO ME ABOUT HOUSE), league, deltarune, cookie run, bojack horseman, valorant, horror games of any kind, hollow knight, wakfu, and baldur's gate. If you like these things I would be down to chill!

Some notes about me: Due to my mental illnesses I heavily connect with characters in either a loving manner that feels like real love or almost like plurality (not sure if theres a better term for it, but it comes from my dissociative disorder). In this case for me, I heavily associate myself with these characters:

I do not like fighting with people over ships, and I wont partake in ship discourse, I instead just block people. I am heavily attached to Tenna and do selfship incredibly with him, and dont want to argue with people about it (im not non sharing cause i think its stupid, but please dont come up to me talking about other ships being canon or better than selfshipping.) When dressed as Tenna I dont mind ships, except spamtenna (i really dont like it im sorry!) every other ship should be okay (within reason)! for CRK: I WILL NOT ARGUE ABOUT DECEIT POLYCULE, ME AND MY POLYCULE IRL HAVE CONNECTED OURSELVES TO DECEIT POLYCULE AND WE DO NOT WANT TO ARGUE WITH PEOPLE WHO SEE THEM AS FAMILY. We can just hold hands, I do not see anything wrong with family headcanons aslong as you dont use them to try and call me a bad person.

  I dont mind if you wanna sit with me! anyone is allowed aslong as your not in my iwc list in my carrd. For candy apple; if other black sapphires/shadow milks/pure vanillas or truthless recluses sit with me or wanna talk! Friends are always allowed to come sit and talk to me even if i may be afk! I love making new friends, but do note not every deceit guy i sit with is my polycule (they rarely go on ponytown).
