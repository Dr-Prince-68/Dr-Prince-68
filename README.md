I tend to be afk or doing stuff while on ponytown, but if you whisper to me I will eventually answer back! I am very into House MD, Mob psycho 100, SCP, league, deltarune, cookie run, bojack horseman, portal, valorant, horror games of any kind, hollow knight, wakfu, and baldur's gate. If you like these things I would be down to chill!

Some notes about me: Due to my mental illnesses I heavily connect with characters in either a loving manner that feels like real love or almost like plurality (not sure if theres a better term for it, but it comes from my dissociative disorder). In this case for me, I heavily associate myself with these characters:

I do not like fighting with people over ships, but I do like talking about ships and how fandom culture is! I absolutely WONT argue with you or talk ships if you don't know what the terms you are saying mean (ie. shipping discourse terms, because most of you dont know the history behind these terms or what they actually mean), I instead just block people.
